# game_Unit-5

We built this two-person game using the following technologies: Figma, Kaboom, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Game description: players 1 and 2 of the game must collect logs to build their wood stack to get out of the ditch. If either player collects logs, a step of a ladder is built. If either player collects rock items, the ability to ‘attack’ the opponent is enabled. If attacked by a rock item, the player loses a step of the ladder, and otherwise is safe. The first player one out of the ditch is the winner of the game, and the game ends. The option to restart the game is available.
